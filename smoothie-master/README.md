Smoothie - a lightweight and modular JavaScript library
=======================================================

**Important notice:** Smoothie will be replaced by "[Tarp.require](https://github.com/letorbi/smoothie/tree/tarp)"
by the end of 2017. Tarp.require is a vastly improved version of Smoothie's require,
so I recommend to use Tarp.require once the switch has been done. However, since
Tarp.require lacks Smoothie's loader code, you might want to continue to use Smoothie.
In that case you can use the smoothie-branch of this repository. The smoothie-branch
is already available so I recommend to switch as soon as possible.

Well, I guess it will still take some time until this repository here contains
a whole library, but I'm working on it ;)

Right now it only contains my implementation of the CommonJS module
specification. More information can be found in my post at Pixel vs. Bytes:
